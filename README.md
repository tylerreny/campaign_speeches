# Campaign Speeches

This file contains CSV files of election campaign speeches from the 2016, 2012, and 2008 elections that I scraped from the [UCSB Presidency Project Website](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election.php) and the python code I used to collect the data. There are no promises that the data is completely accurate, so be sure to check it against the database if you use it.
